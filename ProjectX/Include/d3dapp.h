 * FUNCTION PROTOTYPES

/*
 * D3DAppCreateFromHWND
 *
 * Call this before all other D3DApp functions (except AddTexture).  
 * Initializes all DD and D3D objects necessary for rendering, enumerates the
 * available display modes and drivers and loads textures specified by prior
 * AddTexture() calls.  Caller passes the handle of the window to be manged
 * and callback functions to execute for device creation and destruction.
 * 
 * DeviceCreateCallback is executed AFTER the creation of D3D device and all
 * objects D3DApp created using the device.  This allows an application to
 * reconstruct the scene and create any additional objects.  The callback
 * must create and return (in the variable provided) the DIRECT3DVIEWPORT
 * from the given width and height.  The returned pointer is stored in the
 * D3DAppInfo structure and used for clearing and setting the render state.
 * A NULL pointer is fine if D3DApp is not used for either of these
 * functions. The create callback will always be called before any calls to
 * the destroy callback.  The boolean returned indicates success or failure.
 *
 * DeviceDestroyCallback is executed BEFORE the D3D device and objects
 * created by D3DApp using the device are released.  This allows an
 * application to save data regarding the scene or release any objects
 * created from the device before it is destroyed.  The DIRECT3DVIEWPORT
 * should be released in this callback.  The boolean returned indicates the
 * success or failure.
 *
 * A pointer to the internal D3DAppInfo data structure is returned.  This
 * should be READ ONLY!
 *
 * The DirectDraw device, Direct3D driver, display mode and texture format
 * will all be chosen by D3DApp.  Hardware DD and D3D devices are prefered.
 * Mono lighting D3D drivers are prefered.  Paletted texture formats are
 * prefered.  If possible, the current window size will be used, otherwise
 * a fullscreen mode will be selected.
 *
 * Call AddTexture() to add textures to be loaded upon initialization.
 *
 * Valid flags:
 *    D3DAPP_ONLYSYSTEMMEMORY  Force all surfaces into system memory.  Also
 *                             disables hardware DD and D3D drivers.
